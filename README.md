# Basic Network Sniffer

This project implements a basic network sniffer using Python. A network sniffer captures and analyzes packets of data transmitted over a network. This tool can help in understanding network traffic and identifying potential security issues.

## Features

- **Packet Capture**: Capture packets on a specified network interface.
- **Packet Analysis**: Analyze various network protocols (e.g., Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP).
- **Logging**: Log captured packets to a file for later analysis.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
- **Scapy**: A powerful Python library used for network packet manipulation and analysis.

## Installation

### Install Python 3
Python 3 can be installed from the official website or using a package manager:

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3
